# 1D-Cellular-Automata
 1 dimensional cellular automata created in Python using the PyGame library.

 The rule applied can be changed, as the code includes a converter that translates the rule introduced, in decimal format, to a binary format that is used to decide the state of each cell for the next generation.

 Here are a couple of examples:

### Rule 90:
